WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   M_statemachine_q[4]_GND_45_o_Mux_422_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    54 out of   1,430    3%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        48 out of   2,860    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          153
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            85 out of     153   55%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              20 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
